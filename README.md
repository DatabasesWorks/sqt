# sqt
`sqt` (sql query tool) is a cross-platform program to provide typical sql data source exploring and programming interface.

## Overview
The subject was aimed to provide fast and convenient ms sql query tool under linux. The only existing ODBC interface lead to support of any other ODBC data source. As a result of pgAdmin3 deprecation `sqt` was modified to have a native PostgreSQL support via libpq. The main target audience are db programmers.

`sqt` has fully customizible objects tree, dependent content view and sql highlighting. See [scripts/README.md](https://github.com/parihaaraka/sqt/tree/master/scripts) and any existing `hl.conf` for more details.
